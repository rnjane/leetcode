    Preorder traversal follows Root -> Left -> Right, therefore, given the preorder array preorder,
    we have easy access to the root which is preorder[0].

    Inorder traversal follows Left -> Root -> Right, therefore if we know the position of Root,
    we can recursively split the entire array into two subtrees.

    recursivr fxn:
    it will set the first element of preorder as the root, and then construct the entire tree.
    To find the left and right subtrees, it will look for the root in inorder,
    so that everything on the left should be the left subtree, and everything on the right should be the right subtree.
    Both subtrees can be constructed by making another recursion call.

    It is worth noting that, while we recursively construct the subtrees,
    we should choose the next element in preorder to initialize as the new roots.
    This is because the current one has already been initialized to a parent node for the subtrees.

Complexity analysis

Let NN be the length of the input arrays.

Time complexity : O(N)O(N).

Building the hashmap takes O(N)O(N) time, as there are NN nodes to add, and adding items to a hashmap has a cost of O(1)O(1), so we get N \cdot O(1) = O(N)Nâ‹…O(1)=O(N).

Building the tree also takes O(N)O(N) time. The recursive helper method has a cost of O(1)O(1) for each call (it has no loops), and it is called once for each of the NN nodes, giving a total of O(N)O(N).

Taking both into consideration, the time complexity is O(N)O(N).

Space complexity : O(N)O(N).

Building the hashmap and storing the entire tree each requires O(N)O(N) memory. The size of the implicit system stack used by recursion calls depends on the height of the tree, which is O(N)O(N) in the worst case and O(\log N)O(logN) on average. Taking both into consideration, the space complexity is O(N)O(N).
